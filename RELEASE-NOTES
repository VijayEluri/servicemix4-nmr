                   Apache ServiceMix NMR 1.2.0
                   ===========================

  Overview
  --------

  ServiceMix NMR 1.2.0 contains many bug fixes as well as feature enhancements.  ServiceMix Kernel has been moved to the
  Apache Felix project and renamed as Apache Felix Karaf.  This release of NMR uses Karaf 1.4.0.  This brings with it
  some changes to the command line syntax and a more standardized approach to the command line implementation by using
  the Apache Felix Gogo project.  This release also now includes full support for OSGi fragment bundles as provided by
  the Felix 2.0.4 release.

  This release also implements some of the Enterprise OSGi 4.2 specifications, with more to follow in subsequent
  releases.

  See the change log below for more informations.

                  Apache ServiceMix NMR 1.0.0
                  ===========================

  Overview
  --------

 ServiceMix NMR 1.0.0 is a brand new JBI container based on OSGi.  A lot of work has been done to follow more closely
 the rules from the JBI 1.0 specification and to have a much better lifecycle processing for various JBI artifacts.
 A new clustering engine has been developped which allows endpoints to be individually clustered, leveraging the
 transparent remoting (communications between two endpoints on different JBI containers) but also load-balancing and
 fail-over.  Other features include the backporting of the auditor package from ServiceMix 3, the integration of the
 transaction manager and a JNDI/OSGi integration.

 See the change log below for more informations.

  Migrating from ServiceMix 3
  ---------------------------

 Most of the applications developped for ServiceMix 3 can be deployed onto this container, however, due to the OSGi
 layer underneath, some classloading related issues may arise when migrating an application from ServiceMix 3 because
 both containers do not behave the same way.  Another major change compared to ServiceMix 3 is the changed transactional
 model which allows the use of transactions for asynchronous exchanges: this change will affect your application if you
 were leveraging the JCA flow in ServiceMix 3.

 ** Task
     * [SMX4NMR-16] - Full JBI 1.0 compatibility
     * [SMX4NMR-50] - Make sure that shutting down the jbi layer cleanly shuts down all the JBI artifacts deployed (using both JBI and OSGi packaging)
     * [SMX4NMR-69] - Use managed dependencies instead of specifying the versions in all poms
     * [SMX4NMR-74] - Change the distribution to include ant tasks and the kernel to have a fully operational minimal jbi container
     * [SMX4NMR-91] - Create an example showing how to access the NMR from an osgi bundle to send exchanges
     * [SMX4NMR-92] - Create an example showing how to write an NMR endpoint
     * [SMX4NMR-102] - Move transactions support from the features project to the NMR
     * [SMX4NMR-107] - Use EasyMock for mock testing
     * [SMX4NMR-111] - Make sure the JBI plugin can be used to deploy jbi artifacts onto the NMR

 ** Test
     * [SMX4NMR-126] - Cluster engine tests fails on Hudson -- forked test times out in 60 seconds
     * [SMX4NMR-127] - ChannelImplTest.testDispatchAsync failed on my box caused by time issue



  Known Issues
  ------------

  * [SMX4NMR-128] - JBI Cluster Engine unit tests stall intermittently

                  ================================

  Overview
  --------

 This this milestone contains only a single change, which is related to the lifecycle
 of JBI endpoints using the OSGi packaging.  A service assembly is now created for the
 deployed spring configuration and the JBI lifecycle can now be applied to such
 endpoints.
 See the change log below for more informations.

  Changelog
  ---------

 The following list shows the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release:

 ** Bug
     * [SMX4NMR-52] - Use version ranges to make sure the NMR can be deployed at least onto ServiceMix Kernel 1.0.0

 ** Improvement
     * [SMX4NMR-51] - Exchange should be logged at debug level as in smx3

 ** New Feature
     * [SMX4NMR-24] - Lifecycle / clean shutdown for service assemblies deployed with the OSGi packaging


  Known Issues
  ------------

 * no support for JMX deployment and Ant tasks
 * no support for Service Assemblies Connections


                  Apache ServiceMix NMR 1.0.0-m2
                  ================================

  Overview
  --------

 This second milestone of Apache ServiceMix NMR contains a bunch of new features and bug fixes.
 The most important one is SMX4NMR-28, which allows JBI components to be deployed as pure OSGi
 bundles, thus bypassing the JBI packaging.  This feature is really important in that it allows
 JBI components to leverage the OSGi platform.
 See the change log below for more informations.

  Changelog
  ---------

 The following list shows the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release:

 ** Bug
     * [SMX4NMR-27] - x.x-SNAPSHOT versions startup problem
     * [SMX4NMR-34] - classloader incorrect used in ComponentImpl
     * [SMX4NMR-35] - NMR throws a null pointer exception when I attempt to deploy the ode bpel engine.
     * [SMX4NMR-41] - The JBI layer does not unregister the endpoint associated to the component when the component is unregistered
     * [SMX4NMR-42] - Start, Stop and Shutdown methods on the JBI component lifecycle are not called in the right thread context classloader
     * [SMX4NMR-43] - When the OSGi bundle containing the JBI component is stopped, the component should be stopped / shutdown correctly
     * [SMX4NMR-44] - NPE when unregistering endpoints
     * [SMX4NMR-45] - The SMX4 NMR can not correctly handle the "http://www.w3.org/2004/08/wsdl/in-opt-out" MEP
     * [SMX4NMR-46] - NMR endpoints statistics are not updated
     * [SMX4NMR-48] - When stopping a JBI component, the framework tries to stop SAs, even if they are already stopped, thus leading to an exception

 ** Improvement
     * [SMX4NMR-36] - add javax.xml.bind as hidden for MultiParentClassLoader in Deployer
     * [SMX4NMR-40] - Optimize message dispatch

 ** New Feature
     * [SMX4NMR-28] - Ability for a JBI component to register itself in the registry, thus bypassing the JBI packaging and allowing pure bundles to register JBI components
     * [SMX4NMR-29] - Security in NMR (provides an authentication and an authorization mechanism)
     * [SMX4NMR-30] - Split the document repository and url handler in its own bundle
     * [SMX4NMR-37] - Provide a way to retrieve a ComponentContext for client side

 ** Task
     * [SMX4NMR-32] - Extract bundles from the svn tree


  Known Issues
  ------------

 * no support for JMX deployment and Ant tasks
 * no support for Service Assemblies Connections
 

                  Apache ServiceMix NMR 1.0-m1
                  ================================

See the README.txt file for more general informations about ServiceMix NMR.

This is the first milestone of ServiceMix NMR.  All the features are not
fully implemented yet and things may be changed until the final 1.0 release.
Please refer to the web site for more informations and feel free to ask any
questions on the ServiceMix mailing lists or simply to provide feedback 
(we appreciate it very much).

The current feature set includes a JBI container with a few missing things:
  * no support for JMX deployment and Ant tasks
  * no support for Service Assemblies Connections
  * no support for transactions (a transaction manager and a naming context
     can be injected into components if they are available as OSGi services,
     but not transaction processing  - suspend / resume - will be performed,
     as it would be requested for real support)


Thanks you for downloading ServiceMix NMR.  Enjoy !
